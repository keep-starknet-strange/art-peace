Project tracking is done via GitHub [issues](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/art-peace/issues).
First look at open issues to see if your request is already submitted.
If it is comment on the issue requesting assignment, if not open an issue.

We use 3 issue labels for development:

- `feat` -> suggest new feature

These labels are used as prefixes as follows for `issue`, `branch name`, `pr title`:

- `[feat]` -> `feat/{issue #}-{issue name}` -> `feat:`
- `[bug]` -> `bug/{issue #}-{issue name}` -> `bug:`
- `[dev]` -> `dev/{issue #}-{issue name}` -> `dev:`
